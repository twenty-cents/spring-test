# Java Spring workshop on TDD tests

This repository is intented to show how to do TDD tests on a Spring Java Project. On `master` branch, there will be nothing else than this `README` file and a `.gitignore` file.

Each step of TDD development will be tracked as a new branch. To speed up browsing and searching, each branch will start with a number that will stand for TDD step number.

For this project, we chose a TDD Top Down approach.
