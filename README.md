# Java Spring workshop on TDD tests

This repository is intented to show how to do TDD tests on a Spring Java Project. On `master` branch, there will all the tests produced for each step (integration, controller, service and repository). If you want to check each step detail, check the branches.



For this project, we chose a TDD Top Down approach (integration tests -> repository tests).
